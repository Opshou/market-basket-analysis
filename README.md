# market-basket-analysis
## Association rules problem.

We have information on the transactions that are done in a fake e-commerce. We apply a market basket algorithm which allows
us to see which items are usually bought together and how frequently this happens. 

### Data
10.000 transactions, all done within the same month, in which we just see the names of the products that are being bought together.
We don't see how many units of each product are being bought.

Example of a transaction:
{Acer Aspire,Brother Printer Toner,Belkin Mouse Pad,VGA Monitor Cable}
